- Forms for data input
- Early AJAX
- JQuery AJAX Programming Unification
- Backend and Frontend Compartmentalization
- Fullstack Renaissance
## Decadence of JavaScript Request
- The original promise of AJAX
- Backend and Frontend Compartmentalization 
## Fullstack Approaches
- Compartmentalized Backend and Frontend approaches
- Meta-frameworks Approaches
- Server-driven UI Approaches
## Compartmentalized Approaches
Client Only JavaScript frameworks or libraries and API-sytle backend endpoints.
Problems:
- need more developer hours
- more complexities
## Meta-frameworks Approaches
Putting DOM generator in a server and produces HTML.
Problems:
- JavaScript on server
- Meta-frameworks don't produce HTML directly but through DOM simulator
## Server-driven UI Approaches
Server generates HTML and sends it to the client just like the old days.
Problems:
- Some complicated user interactions are hard to achieve.
Reason to choose Server-driven UI Approaches:
- It's more practical to use the server as sources of truth
- Most business logic is already in the server
- Most business problems can be solved this way
- Suitable for Backend first developer
